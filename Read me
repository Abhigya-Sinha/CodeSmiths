Introducing LifeLoop: Your Ultimate Life Assistant Dashboard

LifeLoop is designed to be your all-in-one solution. Think of it as your personal life assistant dashboard—always on, always organized. 
It unifies your subscriptions, bills, warranties, and so much more, providing timely reminders, smart insights, and detailed expense 
analytics. With LifeLoop, you'll save time, reduce errors, and gain unparalleled clarity in your daily life.

Key Features to Simplify Your World:

Subscription Management
LifeLoop tracks all your subscriptions, providing color-coded reminders before renewals. It offers usage-based cancellation suggestions 
and a clear chart of your monthly and annual spending. You'll receive smart alerts like, "Disney+ is renewing in 2 days. Still worth it?" 
helping you make informed decisions.

Bill Consolidation
Consolidate all your bills—electricity, phone, internet, and EMIs—in one place. LifeLoop sends payment reminders, maintains a past payment 
log, and provides a monthly budget snapshot. You'll also get visual spending analytics, such as a 6-month trend, to help you understand your 
financial habits.

Warranty & Receipt Tracker
Easily upload and store your receipts. LifeLoop will auto-detect warranty durations, send expiry reminders, and help you track product repairs 
and their status. An optional warranty extension chatbot is also available for added convenience.

Chore & Task Management
Assign chores to yourself or your roommates and set frequencies (one-time, weekly, monthly). A gamified dashboard with points and a leaderboard 
makes managing tasks more engaging. You'll receive smart reminders like, "Wash dishes in the next 2 hours to maintain streak."

Shared Expenses
LifeLoop simplifies managing shared expenses. Add and auto-split expenses, and use the smart "Who owes whom?" calculator. It tracks payment statuses 
and can generate monthly PDF summaries for easy reconciliation.

Vehicle Maintenance
Log services, insurance, and tests for your vehicles. Track fuel refills and mileage, and visualize your complete service history. LifeLoop also 
includes an emergency contact shortcut and reminders for upcoming maintenance.

Pantry Management
Track the expiry of items in your pantry and fridge with reminders before expiry (e.g., "Milk expires in 2 days"). Get recipe ideas using soon-to-expire 
items, and auto-generate grocery lists. You can even sync pantry data with housemates or family members to ensure everyone is on the same page.
